## Modelagem e Previsão de Emissões de Tendência das Emissões de Gases do Efeito Estufa Emitidos pela Agropecuária no Amazonas

This study aims to compare the effectiveness of Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA methods in forecasting CO_2e emissions from agricultural activities in the state of Amazonas. For this purpose, historical data from the period 1990 to 2022 were utilized. Various Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models were analyzed. The results indicate that, although both methods demonstrate good predictive capabilities, the Exponential Smoothing model showed slightly superior performance in terms of forecast accuracy. This work contributes to the literature by providing a detailed comparative evaluation of these methods, offering valuable insights for forecasting CO_2e emissions and developing more effective environmental policies in Amazonas.
